< Insert Project description >

# What you need
* RaspberryPi Zero W

* 4 female-to-female Jumper Cables
* Micro Usb Cable (to power RaspberryPi)
* PowerBank (optional)
* Smartphone with MobileHotspot (optional)
  
# Install  
  
## 1. Setup RaspberryPi Zero W
Follow this Guide to setup your pi: https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/raspberry-pi-zero-creation.pdf

**WIFI**
Note: To let your pi publish via smartphone hotspot, also add your hotspot wifi-settings to wpa_supplicant.conf file. Change ssid and psk and place this file in boot folder of pi's sd-card:
```
country=DE
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
network={
     ssid="your_home_wifi_ssid"
     scan_ssid=1
     psk="wifi-password"
     key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
network={
     ssid="your_mobile_hotspot_ssid"
     scan_ssid=1
     psk="mobile-hotpost-password"
     key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```

**SSH**
after setting up your pi by following the guide, connect to your pi via ssh:
```
$ ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
```


**optional:**
Force pi from accepting the LANG variable sent by my computer via ssh. was necessary when using a mac:
```
$ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
* comment out ```AcceptEnv LANG LC_``` with a #
* CTRL+0 & enter to save file
* CTRL+X to exit

**change hostname**
```
$ sudo nano /etc/hostname
```
* change 'raspberrypi' to your desired hostname and safe file

```
$ sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
* change 'raspberrypi' to your desired hostname and save file

```
$ sudo reboot
```

after setting up your new hostname you can access your pi with:
```
$ ssh pi@<your-host-name>.local
```

## 2. Connect Sensors to your pi


< Images and explanation how to connect stuff to the pi >

## 2. Install Dependencies  
```  
$ sudo apt-get install git python3-pip minicom gpsd gpsd-clients
$ sudo pip3 install paho-mqtt requests pyserial pynmea2 gpsd-py3 
```  

## 4. GPS-Sensor Configurations

**edit /boot/config.txt:**
```
$ sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```
At the bottom of the file add following lines and save file:
```
# Enable UART
dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt
core_freq=250
enable_uart=1
force_turbo=1
```

**edit cmdline.txt:**
make a copy of cmdline.txt file
```
$ sudo cp /boot/cmdline.txt /boot/cmdline.txt.backup
```
Edit cmdline.txt file:
```
$ sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
```
* Remove ```console=serial0,115200``` and modify ```root=/dev/mmcblk0p2``` so that the file will probably look like this:
```
dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait
```
* save the file

```
$ sudo reboot
```

**Stop and disable the Piâ€™s serial ttyS0 service**
```
$ sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyS0.service
$ sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyS0.service
```
following commands will enable it again if needed:
```
$ sudo systemctl enable serial-getty@ttyS0.service
$ sudo systemctl start serial-getty@ttyS0.service
```
reboot:
```
$ sudo reboot
```

**enable ttyAMA0 service (the one for the gps-sensor):**
```
$ sudo systemctl enable serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service
```

* Configure the module for the 9600 rate:
```
stty -F /dev/ttyAMA0 9600
```

* Connect AMA0 to the GPS Software First kill the process and add the device to gpsd tool
	* gpsd is a daemon which buffers the gps data from the Neo6m-sensor
```
sudo killall gpsd
sudo nano /etc/default/gpsd
```

* Edit the file /etc/default/gpsd and add your serial port in DEVICES, like
```
DEVICES="/dev/ttyAMA0"
```

* enable gpsd to start at boot:
```
sudo systemctl enable gpsd.socket
sudo systemctl start gpsd.socket 
```

reboot:
```
$ sudo reboot
```

**test your gps sensor:**
```
$ cgps -s
```

# 4. Setup measuring

* Clone this repository on your pi.  
* Setup your configurations in config.py (Thingsboard Token, OpenSenseMap Tokens, ...)
	* Thingsboard and OpenSenseMap Tokens
	* Measure and publishing intervals
	* you can disable publishing to thingsboard or OpenSenseMap if you want
* cd into the repository and run:  
```  
$ sudo python3 measure.py  
```  
* This will start the measuring and will by default measure every 2 seconds and publish data every 15 seconds to thingsboard and opensensemap.  
  
 **Cronjob for autostart at boot:**
* get your python installation path ```$ which python3``
    * mostly ``````
* If you want to run the script automatically on reboot setup a cronjob.  
```  
$ sudo crontab -e  
```  
* select nano as editor by pressing 2
* add following:
```  
@reboot /usr/bin/python3 < PATH_TO_THE_FILE >measure.py &
```
* and then
```  
sudo reboot  
```  

**Start Measuring**
* Turn on mobile hotspot of your smartphone
* boot your pi 
* measuring will autostart and publish data
  
# TODO  
* RPC's via Thingsboard  
* create Thingsboard dashboard  and make it public
* Tuturial for OpenSenseMap Sensor Setup and Thingsboard Setup with dashboard import  
* Make a Poster
